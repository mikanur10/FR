# Forgerock/ID.me

ID.meâ€™s Identity Gateway platform provides an OIDC / OAuth 2.0 capable service. This functionality can be used in conjunction with ForgeRock to enable
applications to participate in a federated single sign-on (SSO) relationship with the ID.me network of
credentials.

## Overview

### Generate an ID.me client 

An ID.me account is required to begin an integration. The only account requirement is completing email verification prior to starting an integration. 

* Navigate to developer.id.me
* If you have an ID.me account, click Sign In, if you do not have an ID.me account, click Sign Up
* Complete Sign In/Up

Now that you have a valid ID.me Developer account, you can: 

* Proceed to `Start a New Integration` and click `Continue` 
* Input organization information and click `Continue`
* Once an organization is created, you can proceed to `View My Applications`
* Click `Create New`
* Input application information. Please note, Only application name, display name, and redirect URI are required fields
* Once all fields are input and formatted correctly, you may proceed to create your OAuth application by clicking `Continue`
* Record your Client ID and Client Secret

__Note: ID.me provides a sandbox environment that allows partners to verify with any data to generate a mocked response. Contact ID.me to provide the appropriate credentials and access to begin the integration. Email ID.me at partnersupport@id.me for policy information and sandbox access.__

### Add ID.me as an Identity Provider

* In the AM Admin UI, go to `Realms` > `Realm Name` > `Services`.
* Check if `Social Identity Provider Service` appears in the list of services configured for the realm.
* If it does not, add it: Click on `Add a Service`, and select `Social Identity Provider Service` from the drop-down list.
* The service's Configuration page appears.
* Ensure that the `Enabled` switch is on.
* Go to the `Secondary Configurations` tab.
* In the `Add a Secondary Configuration` drop-down list, select ID.me as the identity provider.
* If you do not see ID.me, select the following to add a custom identity provider client: `Client Configuration for providers that implement the OpenID Connect specification`
* The new identity provider configuration page appears.

### Configure the Identity Provider with ID.me Details 

Populate the configuration page with details from your ID.me instance. For more information about each option, click on the Tooltip next to each respective field. Below is guide for some of the ID.me specific fields. Do not worry if you are missing some of the details; you will be able to edit the configuration later, after saving the client profile for the first time. Save your changes to access all the configuration fields for the client. 

* `Name`: Provide your own unique identifier 
* `Auth ID Key`: Field used to identify a user by the social provider, likely `id`
* `Client ID` and `Client Secret`: Copied and pasted from your ID.me instance
* `Authentication Endpoint URL`: `https://api.idmelabs.com/oauth/authorize` if testing in sandbox OR `https://api.id.me/oauth/authorize` for a production implementation 
* `Access Token Endpoint URL`: `https://api.idmelabs.com/oauth/token` if testing in sandbox OR `https://api.id.me/oauth/token` for a prooduction implementation 
* `User Profile Service URL`: `https://api.idmelabs.com/api/public/v2/attributes.json` if testing in sandbox OR `https://api.id.me/api/public/v2/attributes.json` for a production implementation
* `Redirect URL`: This will be tenet specific, following the convention `https://[YOUR_FQDN_HERE]/am` 
* `OAuth Scopes`: Gather the scope(s) for the requested resources from your ID.me instance. If you have any questions, work with your ID.me Sales Engineer for guidance. 
* `Well Known Endpoint`: `https://api.idmelabs.com/oidc/.well-known/openid-configuration` if testing in sandbox OR `https://api.id.me/oidc/.well-known/openid-configuration` for a production implementation
* `Issuer`: `https://api.idmelabs.com/oidc` if testing in sandbox OR `https://api.id.me/oidc` for a production implementation
* `JWKS URI Endpoint`: `https://api.idmelabs.com/oidc/.well-known/jwks` if testing in sandbox OR `https://api.id.me/oidc/.well-known/jwks` for a production implementation

### Add Custom Transformation Script 

The Transformation Script maps ID.me attibutes to ForgeRock attributes to create user objects. To create this script, do the following: 

* Navigate to `Scripts` on the left side of the screen, clcik `+ New Script`
* Provide a Name for the script, such as `ID.me Profile Transformation`
* Set `Script Type` to `Social Identity Provider Profile Transformation`
* Within the script field, beginning at line 9, add the following script. This is a sample script with a baseline set attributes. If you would like to further customize this script with additional attributes, please follow this [User Identity Attributes and Properties Reference
](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/idcloud/latest/identities/user-identity-properties-attributes-reference.html)
```
import static org.forgerock.json.JsonValue.field
import static org.forgerock.json.JsonValue.json
import static org.forgerock.json.JsonValue.object

return json(object(
        field("id", rawProfile.uuid),
        field("displayName", rawProfile.fname),
        field("givenName", rawProfile.fname),
        field("familyName", rawProfile.lname),
        field("email", rawProfile.email),
        field("username", rawProfile.email)))
```

### Configure Transformation Script for the Social Provider Handler Node

* Navigate to `Journeys` > `idme` and click to edit the journey
* Click `Social Provider Handler Node`
* On the right-hand side, click the dropdown under `Transformation Script` and select `Normalized Profile to Managed User`
* `Save` changes 

## Test ID.me Configuration

Copy and paste the `Preview URL` option in the top right-hand corner of the screen and test the ID.me/ForgeRock Integration.
